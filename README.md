NDS-Minecraft-Demo

A very simple demo game inspired by Minecraft, developed for the Nintendo DS.
==================

Inspired by an extra-credit assignment from my intro to Computer Graphics class, the project is to build 
a simplified version of Minecraft using OpenGL. The expected components are as follows:
    - Render a world consisting of 64 x 64 cubes, with differing colors/textures, some of which may be "air".
    - Allow the user to navigate through this world as you would be able to in Minecraft: WASD movement, jumping, etc.
    - Provide some method for the user to pickup a block then place it back in the world again.

The primary difference from the original assignment and this project is that this will be developed as a homebrew
program for the Nintendo DS. To interface with the hardware, I intend to use the libnds library, provided with
devkitPro.
